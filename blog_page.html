                  <p>Yo everyone! I am Atmuri Mahesh Sreshti, fondly known as AMS too :p, a fourthie from Energy Science and Engineering, current Team Lead of SPART (Solar Powered Airship Racing Team, a new team) and yeah, the “unanimously elected CR” for 4 consecutive years xD.</p> 

                </br><p>My interest lies primarily in Solar Photovoltaics, and my other interests include Solar Thermal, Wind, Batteries, Nuclear (well, that’s pretty much all renewables). For most of my 5th sem, I was apping (and preparing for it) for an opportunity as a research intern in a foreign university. But all the replies I got were scarred with the COVID reason for accommodating summer interns there. I was applying for a very few interns from PT cell since I didn’t have many options to apply for - core pains :(. As I was going for core profiles, my preparation was more specific to my resume and not very focused on the HR part of an interview. I revised a few concepts that powered my resume's major projects and was confident about my answers to the potential questions.</p> 
                  
              </br> <p>Then came the IAF by British Petroleum (bp, as it is commonly known) which sounded a lot like a core-related profile. The job description read: “Identify the detailed processes of some major industries (steel, cement, refining, petrochemical, ceramic, etc.) and estimate the carbon reduction potential post develop the potential options for providing integrated solutions.” It is one of the world's seven oil and gas "supermajors", and opened a profile related to the carbon footprint of the steel and cement industry. There weren’t too many details related to the job, but the one line in the job description gave a direction to think about. The interview was pretty smooth, where they mainly asked related to the concepts and the profile. Aaaaandd I was selected! :D</p>
                  
            </br><p>During the sem, there was a surprise call from the HR manager saying that my pay got hiked by 80%, and it took some time to sink in. A significant part of my work involved research of manufacturing technologies of steel and cement industries at each process level for carbon reduction potential. I have also researched future technologies for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and decarbonization.</p> 
                  
          </br><p>This internship was a fantastic experience that changed my learning curve a fair bit. My perspective towards materials has completely transformed. The realization that every activity of humans contributes to the ever-rising carbon emissions was priceless. I got exposure to how the corporate world works. The interactions with the CEO of BP India and several other dignitaries were humbling and refreshing about how people in corporate leadership positions think.</p> 
                  
        </br><p>A message (few of them, actually) to my juniors would be not to apply for every profile and IAF out there. This will definitely lead to a lot of rejections, in turn leading to low morale. Always keep your confidence high, and having an optimistic approach in the internship season is a must! Concentrate on what you want to do, the profile which you would like to explore, or would like to pursue your career. I have probably applied for less than 5 IAFs in the entire internship season (wouldn’t recommend this though lol), but quality over quantity should be the mantra. And on a concluding point, don’t get dejected if you are not getting selected and all your friends have an intern in hand already. You never know what life has in store for you!</p>
